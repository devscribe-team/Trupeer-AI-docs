## Summary

The commit removes mock/testing code from the MCP updates pipeline and restores real async function calls for PR documentation updates.

## Changes

**File Modified:** `app/features/MCP/updates.py` (10 insertions, 17 deletions)

<Callout type="info">
The update refactors the `updates_pipeline_streaming` function by restoring the full production workflow.
</Callout>

### Key Modifications

- **Restored real pipeline execution**: Uncommented all async function calls (`pr_info_extraction`, `change_analyzer`, `download_documentation_repo`, `embedder`, `detector`, `generator`) that were previously commented out for testing

- **Removed mock data source**: Commented out the code that read from `fake_result.json` for testing purposes

- **Removed artificial delays**: Deleted `asyncio.sleep(2)` calls that simulated processing time during testing

<Callout type="success">
The pipeline now executes the full documentation update workflow including PR information extraction, change analysis, documentation downloading/embedding, impact detection, and update generation rather than using mocked responses.
